                        <span className='font-bold'>Hi there!</span> I recently graduated with a Software Engineering degree from WGU, focusing on C#, and I also completed Fullstack Academy. I'm passionate about web development, with expertise ranging from vanilla JavaScript to React and backend technologies.

                        <span className='font-bold'>My Journey:</span> I founded Folly Web Design and Marketing, where I built custom web solutions for businesses in Charleston, SC, including liquor stores, construction companies, and restaurants. Although I closed the business in 2016 when I moved to Las Vegas, that experience has shaped my skills and approach to development.
